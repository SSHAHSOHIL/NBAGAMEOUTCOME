# NBA Game Outcome Model


## The purpose of the NBA Game Outcome Model is to be able to build and train a model using TimeSeriesSplit and XGBoost to be able to predict game outcomes in the future. The model predictions would then be compared to future betting odds to evaluate possible profitability.

This project utilizes Python, Pandas, and advanced machine learning techniques to create the most optimized model that can be used on future data. To analyze performance trends and create the model itself, the project involved efficiently web scraping detailed team and player data for the entire 2023-2024 NBA season. Then, rolling averages for each of the teams' stats were implemented to see how teams were playing in previous games as well as an ELO system to evaluate each of the teams based on overall performance.
